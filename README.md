# Battleship

I had built this game before using vanilla javascript, and although fully
functional, updating the DOM became a nightmare and clearly could benefit from
some reactivity.  Why Svelte? Even if I didn't end up using it past this project
I wanted to understand what made it different from other tools that try to solve
similar problems (i.e. Vue).
I ended up liking it's streamlined approach to reactivity and am curious enough
to use it more now having had some experience with it.

Anyway, play the game. Hopefully it works just how you remember it!
